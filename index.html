            non-personally identifying information is to better understand how TheGiftery’s visitors use its
            website. From time to time, TheGiftery may release non-personally-identifying information in the

            TheGiftery also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
            addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://shop.thegiftery.com blog posts.
